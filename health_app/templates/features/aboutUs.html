            <h3>PCOS Pals</h3><br>

            <p>PCOS Pals is a project launched to ensure more women are diagnosed with PCOS as early as possible so they are able to target their symptoms very specifically. </p><br>

            <p>PCOS impacts 1 in 8 women in the UK alone! It’s a common condition that impacts how a woman’s ovaries work. The symptoms of PCOS are excess hair on the face and body, difficulty losing weight, severe acne and much much more. Do those things sound familiar? Yep, those are the aspects of their body that young women are extremely insecure about and it’s absolutely terrible to see it because for a lot of them, it’s not their fault. This can lead to women becoming really sad, knowing that they are not deemed beautiful. When they try to fit into these expectations by going on extreme diets or doing HIIT workouts, this can lead to the opposite of what they would like, making them feel even more helpless. </p><br>

            <p>PCOS is linked to obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, unhealthy cholesterol, depression, anxiety and oh! the list goes on. So no, if you were thinking that this is just a cosmetic problem - I have come to inform you that it is not just that. PCOS is a concern that should be discussed among EVERYONE, women with PCOS, those without and those who aren’t even women. </p><br>

            <p>~70% of women with PCOS remain undiagnosed. Our solution is to streamline the process of PCOS diagnosis by as much as possible to make sure that everyone can be diagnosed as early as possible. Most women receive their diagnosis only when they struggle to have babies, but PCOS is so much more than just infertility and so many- in fact too many young women fail to realise that. </p><br>

            <p>To help achieve our goal, we currently have an instagram account @pcos.pals since we decided that social media would be the best way to increase awareness about PCOS amongst the youth. By increasing awareness, we hope that more young women will take the initiative to go find out at their local GP if they do have PCOS. </p><br>
